he present report describes our analysis of the GigaDB Brain Computer Interface (BCI) dataset [1]. The dataset consists of 60 channel EEG, 7 channel EMG, and 4 channel EOG signals from 25 neurotypical right-handed adult participants (15 M, 24-32 years of age). Over the course of three recording sessions, eleven motor movements were recorded when the participant was either performing or imagining the movement. The motor movements were all upper-limb movements that consisted of arm-reaching in six directions, three different hand-grasps, and wrist twisting movements.

The notebook dim_reduction_withClassification.ipynb shows our results across these combinations.
