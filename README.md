# EE560_final_project
Mia Hoffman, Zoe Steine-Hanson, Doris Voina

This project uses data from "Multimodal signal dataset for 11 intuitive movement tasks from single upper extremity during multiple recording sessions" (Jeong et al. 2020).
We test the combination of different data streams (EEG and EMG), two different dimensionality reduction technqiues, and two different classification models, to see which combination presents the best classification accuracy. 

The notebook dim_reduction_withClassification.ipynb shows our results across these combinations.
